## Project Description/Outline

Dairy is a major agricultural product of the United States. Milk is produced in all 50 States, with the major producing States in the West and North [1].From 2004 to 2014, the value of U.S. dairy product exports more than quadrupled, and the United States became the worldâ€™s third-largest dairy product exporter, behind New Zealand and the European Union (EU) [2].
Dairy farms, overwhelmingly family-owned and managed, are generally members of producer cooperatives. The industry has seen a consistent decline in the number of operations, matched by a rise in the number of cows per operation[1]. In addition, dairy farmers are impacted by changes in the domestic and international consumption and production of dairy products. 
In this project we research and visualize several key questions to better understand the domestic supply, demand and trade of dairy products that impact domestic dairy farming. In addition we will visualize global data trends, depending on accessibility of the data.
